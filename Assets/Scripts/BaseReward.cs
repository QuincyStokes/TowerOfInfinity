///how to change enemy health based on hits
///for each enemy store this
///    [ (timeHit, type), (timeHit, type), ...] 
///Then from there, we have some important data:
///         # of hits it took to defeat a certain enemy 
///              (this would be the amount of tuples in our list)
//               We can compare this to the optimal # of hits
///         #average time between hits. 
//              A higher time may mean the player is slow at this particular type, and needs practice

//take all of these factors into consideration
//   create more enemeis with the type of math they are the worst at
//   For example, if the player's # of hits is consistently far above the average for multiplication type enemies, spawn more of them
